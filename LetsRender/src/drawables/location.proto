// The Location class is used to store latitude and longitude values in order
// to mimic the client-side counterpart of Location. The latitude and longitude
// are each represented as single floating point numbers that encompass degrees,
// minutes, and seconds of each point. The direction is represented as the 
// number of degrees that the current direction makes with magnetic North. i.e.
// a direction reading of 0 means that the user is facing the magnetic North.
// 90 = East, 180 = South, 270 = West, 360 = 0 = North
